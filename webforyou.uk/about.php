						<h2>Why Netforyou?</h2>
						<div class="abrow">
							<div class="lefth">
								<h3>Knowledge and&nbsp;experience</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="rightp">
								<p>We have already completed over 70 website designs. This number allowed us not only to gain experience in designing and coding, but also to develop processes and procedures thanks to which we eliminate the risk of errors and improve the implementation of projects. We are constantly developing, adapting our offer to current trends, innovations and gained experience.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
							<div class="abrow">
							<div class="lefth">
								<h3>Teamwork</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="rightp">
								<p>Your project will be supervised by a programmer, graphic designer, marketer, SEO specialist and client advisor, who will work together on every detail of the projects we carry out. Combining experience and knowledge in various fields, we are able to offer our clients the highest quality of services that cannot be provided by a freelancer working on websites during the break between classes at university.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="abrow">
							<div class="lefth">
								<h3 class="h34">Consulting and&nbsp;care</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="rightp">
								<p>Each of our clients receives the support of an advisor from the moment of the first contact to the finalization of the project. His role is not only to sign the contract, but also to translate the IT language, i.e. advice and assistance in choosing the most optimal solutions and supervision over the correct flow of information and proper implementation of the contract at all stages of our work.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="abrow">
							<div class="lefth">
								<h3>Fair rules</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="rightp">
								<p>We often hear about cases where the final cost of creating a website "somehow" doubled during implementation ... With us you can count on fair rules that are defined in a transparent offer and a precise contract. We inform you about any elements that may involve additional costs before signing the contract, and if we have not been able to predict them, we always look for the most beneficial solutions for our clients.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="abrow">
							<div class="lefth">
								<h3>Timeliness guarantee</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="rightp">
								<p>We are often approached by people who have been waiting for half a year for the initial design of a website that they ordered from another company. For us, such situations are unacceptable. We know how much a company can gain from a good website and at the same time how much it can lose when its website does not work properly, which is why we pay special attention to meeting the agreed deadlines.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="abrow">
							<div class="lefth">
								<h3>Complex offer</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="rightp">
								<p>So that our clients are not forced to look for many contractors, apart from designing websites, we provide preparation for positioning, copywriting, image optimization as well as creating a client's hosting account and placing website files there. After the end of our cooperation, the website will be available on the Internet! </p>
