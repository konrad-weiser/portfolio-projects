				<p class="curp">Do you know that...</p>
				<p class="curcontent">
					A professional website can significantly contribute to attracting new customers? How does it work? One of the most popular forms of gaining visibility on the web is website positioning. Every day people search online for services like yours. For example, "London repair crew" is searched for an average of 4,600 times each day. Imagine how much benefit from visibility in the search engine a hairdressing company can have - and without intermediaries! If you run a business, you just need to be online!

				<h2>FAQ - Frequently asked questions</h2>
				<div class="faq">
					<div class="question">
						<span>Website development - How much does it cost?</span>
						<i class="icon-right-open"></i>
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>It is very difficult to answer this question because it depends on many factors. This is about the same question as "how much does it cost to build a house?". This is influenced by many factors, ranging from the number of subpages, graphic materials or text, to the number of desired solutions.</p><p>With us, the cheapest websites cost 380£. In order to easily price websites for our clients, we have prepared price packages that will easily allow them to adjust their budget to our capabilities. This solution has already been appreciated by many of our customers.</p><p>If you decide to do your own website development process using a website builder, it won't necessarily be free. Free sites tend to be very limited, and you have to pay for extensive features. Such a site also requires maintenance, so you can expect a monthly subscription for maintaining the website from the website builder.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="faq">
					<div class="question">
						<span> How long does it typically take to create a website?</span>
						<i class="icon-right-open"></i>
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>It depends on many factors. Some freelancers create really simple websites in just a few hours, but they are not the most successful projects. It is worth considering that a person creating a website for 100£ will not spend 2 weeks on it. He must finish it as soon as possible.</p><p>With us, the average time needed to successfully complete a website is about 3 weeks. Although it depends mainly on contact with the client. Many times we were able to finish pages after only 7 days.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="faq">
					<div class="question">
						<span>Does the website require maintenance?</span>
						<i class="icon-right-open"></i>
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>
							Unfortunately, the website needs maintenance. It is mandatory to maintain elements such as domain and server (hosting). Without them, the site will not function. If you are new to these topics, don't worry - we will help you find a good hosting offer and put your website on the Internet!

				<div class="faq">
					<div class="question">
						<span>Creating websites - What does it look like?</span>
						<i class="icon-right-open"></i>
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>First of all, you will tell us what your requirements are, we will choose a price package and set the terms of cooperation. At the very beginning, we will sign a contract and collect an advance payment. We will then create a blueprint for your future website.</p><p>Once we know what the website will look like, we start preparing the necessary materials such as content and graphics, logo. After preparation, we place them on the website and start testing. If we find any bugs, we'll fix them. You can also test the demo version of your website and if you don't like something, we'll fix it.</p><p>All that remains is to optimize the site from a technical point of view, ensure good loading times and a good user experience. The website prepared in this way can be published on the Internet.</p><p>If you are interested in a modern website, choose our agency. We will take care of everything comprehensively and you will receive a guarantee! If you want, create a website in a website builder, but our specialists are really good at this.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="faq">
					<div class="question">
						<span>What benefits will the website give me?</span>
						<i class="icon-right-open"></i>
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>A website can bring many benefits, provided that it is properly created and optimized. First of all, it is a great benefit for companies, because a website can be an online showcase. On such a page you will find all the important information about the company and the services you offer. This is a great convenience for potential customers.</p><p>Another big benefit is the ability to acquire new customers via the Internet by using, for example, the Google search engine. Your website can be found in search results thanks to SEO. Website positioning is also part of our comprehensive services. People in your area are looking for services like yours every day. It's worth taking advantage of.</p><p>If your website starts to enjoy regular and high traffic (e.g. by publishing blog entries), it is worth thinking about paid ads or sponsored content. This way you can earn extra money.</p>

				<div class="faq">
					<div class="question">
						<span>Creating a website - is it difficult?</span>
						<i class="icon-right-open"></i>
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>Anyone can create a website on their own and it's no secret. First of all, you have to choose whether you will create your own website with a free website builder or will you choose independence? The website creator is usually not completely free, because you usually have to pay a monthly subscription for website maintenance anyway. In addition, interesting features are usually paid as well.</p><p>If you want to be independent, start by buying a domain and server or let us create such a website. Website development is an area like many others in life and it requires experience to be able to say that you have made a professional website.</p><p>Anyone can create a website these days. A website builder – unfortunately has its downsides. While such websites are adapted to mobile devices, it is very easy to overload them with plugins or unnecessary functionalities. It is worth keeping this in mind when creating a website using a website builder, so that the created project works as quickly as possible.</p>
